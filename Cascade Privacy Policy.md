## **Information Collection and Use**
### 1. Log Data
If an error happens while using the Cascade app, I collect data and information about that error. This collection of error data are called Logs. Logs may include information like IP Adress, device name, operating system version, time and date, and configuration settings for the Cascade app. These error logs are extremely helpful for updating and maintaining the app.

### 2. Links to Other Sites
The Cascade app contains links to other sites. Clicking on a link to a third party site will direct you to that site. These external sites are not operated by me, so I recommend you check out their privacy policies beforehand. I assume zero responsibility for the content, policies, and or practicies of any other sites or third-party services.

Cascade app is not intended for children under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under 13. If I become aware that we have collected Personal Data from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, I will delete that information.

### 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy
I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" above.
